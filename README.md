## CLARC: C/C++ Benchmark for Robust Code Search
Effective retrieval of code snippets using natural language queries is crucial in software engineering to enhance code reuse and development efficiency. Current evaluation datasets for this task predominantly focus on Python, the most common programming language for research, leaving a gap in benchmarks for industry-focused languages like C or C++. Furthermore, existing datasets often lack structured categorization and can rely heavily on superficial features, such as the direct overlap between code identifiers and query keywords. To address these limitations, we introduce CLARC (C/C++ LAnguage Retrieval with Anonymized Code), a novel benchmark for C/C++ code search. CLARC consists of code snippets and corresponding queries organized into three distinct groups based on their dependencies. We also provide various settings for CLARC that test model robustness by removing superficial code features through anonymization. Additionally, an automated pipeline is designed to expand CLARC while preserving data quality. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClarcTeam/CLARC.
